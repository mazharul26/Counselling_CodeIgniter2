There is currently no cure for ALS. However, there are many medications that are used to help relieve symptoms, such as muscle cramps and fatigue, although they are not indicated to treat the disease. There are also 2 prescription medications that are FDA-approved for the treatment of ALS:

    Riluzole (also known as Rilutek®) was approved in 1995
    Radicava® (edaravone) was approved in 2017

In clinical trials, Radicava® was shown to slow decline in the loss of functional ability in people with ALS (learn more). Radicava® may be received on its own or along with riluzole.

Managing ALS takes a multidisciplinary approach, which allows people with ALS to receive care from professionals with different areas of expertise. If you think you have ALS, talk to your HCP today. He or she will assess your condition and may refer you to an ALS clinic, where you can meet with many different medical experts during a single visit.

Also, be sure to ask your HCP about available treatments, such as Radicava®. Your HCP can help you decide which options are right for you.


Worldwide, there are around 160 million people who are visually impaired and have some degree of low vision. Low vision is often characterized by partial sight, such as blurred vision, distorted vision, shadows, blind spots or tunnel vision, but the term also includes legal blindness. If you are affected by an eye condition such as Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Macular Degeneration or Retinitis Pigmentosa, you can still live independently if you are supported by low vision aids
<h4>Macular Degeneration</h4>
Macular Degeneration is a medical condition often associated with aging (also referred to as “age-related Macular Degeneration”) that results in a loss of vision in the centre of your visual field. Central vision helps us to see objects clearly and perform tasks such as reading and driving.
