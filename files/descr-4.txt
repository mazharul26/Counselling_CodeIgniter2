Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication brought on by diabetes where the retina, the lightsensitive tissue that lines the inner surface of the eye, is damaged. Diabetes causes abnormal changes in the body’s blood sugar levels. High levels of blood sugar can alter the blood flow to the body’s organs, including the eyes.
